## pipeline-compile-less


## Information

| Package       | Description   | Version|
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| pipeline-compile-less| This pipeline compiles LESS files and returns CSS files | 0.4.0 |

# Overview

This pipeline assists the compilation of LESS into CSS, while optionally allowing for autoprefixing and concatination.

**NOTE: as this project is still pre 1.0.0, it is subject to possible backwards incompatible changes as it matures.
Also, as part of a repo migration, version 0.2.0 will not install, so please use any of the newer versions**

## Install
`npm install pipeline-compile-less.git --save-dev`

**note: https://github.com/kenzanlabs/pipeline-compile-less/issues/7**

## Usage
```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp');
var lessPipeline = require('pipeline-compile-less');


gulp.task('default', function() {
  return gulp
    .src(['src/**/*.less'])
    .pipe(lessPipeline.compileLESS());
});

//Usage with options
gulp.task('default', function() {
  return gulp
    .src(['src/**/*.less'])
    .pipe(lessPipeline.compileLESS({concatCSS: true}));
});
```

## Options

Pipeline options:
* _config_ -> Object that contains the configuration.

    * __autoprefix__ If you don't want to have your CSS rules prefixed set this property to __false__.
    
    * __concatCSS__ If set to __false__ the pipeline won't concatenate the files to generate a single CSS file.

    * __outputFileName__ If __concatCSS__ is set to __true__, this value will be used to name the file. By default, the config is set to get the name of the package that consumes pipeline-compile-less. So for example, it would end up named as `your-project.css`. If you set this value, do not suffix the string with '.css', as this is handled internally.

    * __addSourceMaps__ If set to __false__ source maps won't be generated for the compiled files. By default the pipeline will generate the source maps and store them in _maps_.

    * __plugins__ Gathers all of the specific configurations for the tasks used in the pipeline.

      * __plugins.autoprefix__ Adds vendor specific prefixes automatically for the last 2 versions. Also, you can provide your own autoprefix configuration setting an object-- following [this](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#browsers) rules.


  Default:
  ```javascript
  config = {
    autoprefix: true,
    concatCSS: false,
    outputFileName: '{package-name}.css',  //uses the name of the current package, from package.json
    addSourceMaps: true,
    plugins: {
      autoprefix: {browsers: ['last 2 versions']},
    }
  };
  ```  

## Results

This pipeline returns an object. This object receives a stream with the LESS files to compile, and you can call the _compileLESS_ method to execute the compilation. After finishing the process you will have a folder named as _config.output_ . This folder can contain files as follows:

  + All of the CSS files generated; keeping the same folder structure from the source.

  + The CSS rules that need vendor prefixes will be completed based on [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

  + Source maps will be store in _config.output/maps_. This can be avoid setting _config.addSourceMaps_ to __false__.

  + If _config.concatCSS_ is __true__ a `concat.css` file will be generated.
  
  + If _config.outputFileName_ is set, that name will be used (and suffixed with '.css') instead of picking up the consuming package name as a default value. For example, the compiled file would be named as `your-custom-value.css` if you used 'your-custom-value'.
